#
# Validates the Prisma schema and checks for generated-code drift.
# Intended for use in CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) on every PR that
# touches prisma/schema.prisma or src/generated/.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Schema is valid, generation succeeds, no drift detected
#   1 - Validation or generation failure
#   2 - Generated code drift detected (schema changed but generated files were not updated)
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/validate-schema.sh
#   npm run validate:schema
